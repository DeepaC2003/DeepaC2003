AI enthusiast, poet on weekends and someone who finally decided to take her career seriously (like… actually seriously).

I build things that learn, generate, reason and sometimes misbehave.  
Working on becoming the kind of AI engineer who **writes cleaner pipelines than code**,  
**debugs calmly** and **cries only during hyperparameter tuning** (growth).

### (◣_◢) What I'm into:
- Deep Learning, LLMs, diffusion models  
- MLOps and production-grade ML (no more “it worked on my machine”)  
- Research-y experiments that eat GPU for breakfast  
- Elegant documentation because chaos belongs *inside* models, not repos  

### (⌒_⌒;) Current mode:
Willing to put in the work, break the cycle and actually ship projects instead of just thinking about them at 3 AM.

### (๑>ᴗ<๑) Fun fact:
When I’m not training models, I’m writing ... poetry, ideas, or existential tech rants that may or may not become research papers someday.

If you vibe with neural networks, quirky energy, or serious ambition wrapped in humor .. we’ll get along.
