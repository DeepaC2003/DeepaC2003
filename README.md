## 👋 Hey, I'm Deepa  


AI enthusiast, poet on weekends and someone who finally decided to take her career seriously (like… actually seriously).

I build things that learn, generate, reason and sometimes misbehave.  
Working on becoming the kind of AI engineer who **writes cleaner pipelines than code**,  
**debugs calmly** and **cries only during hyperparameter tuning** (growth).

### 🔬 What I'm into:
- Deep Learning, LLMs, diffusion models  
- MLOps & production-grade ML (no more “it worked on my machine”)  
- Research-y experiments that eat GPU for breakfast  
- Elegant documentation because chaos belongs *inside* models, not repos  

### 🚀 Current mode:
Willing to put in the work, break the cycle and actually ship projects instead of just thinking about them at 3 AM.

### ✍️ Fun fact:
When I’m not training models, I’m writing — poetry, ideas, or existential tech rants that may or may not become research papers someday.

If you vibe with neural networks, quirky energy, or serious ambition wrapped in humor — we’ll get along.
